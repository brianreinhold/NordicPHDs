The HealthAtHome.apk is the 'primary' client application. Without the Ghs or Met drivers the application
supports the BT-SIG health device standards and some proprietary devices.

The GhsBtSigDriver.apk is a plugin which, when installed, gives the HealthAtHome application GHS support
The MetDriver.apk is a plugin which, when installed, gives the HealthAtHome application MPM support.

The drivers can be installed and uninstalled independent of the HealthAtHome application. There are
additional plugins for other proprietary devices but they are not necessary for testing the GHS and
MPM peripherals in this repository.
